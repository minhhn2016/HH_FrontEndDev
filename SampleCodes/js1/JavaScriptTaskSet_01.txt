JavaScript task 01           (Not for the beginners' course!)

Look at the given JavaScriptTask_Screenshot.png picture. Implement it a JavaScript program. No CSS this time. Only one HTML and one JS file.

Spend no time with the styles, colors, widths, heights. Just concentrate on valid and nicely indented HTML and JS code. Use validators.

You can call your folder: 01_PlayersPoints_Add_List_FindWinners

Do not write any JavaScript inside your script elements. I.e. use an external and linked JavaScript file.

(The result of this task will be the starting point of the next programming task)
